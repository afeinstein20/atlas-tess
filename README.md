Data and Python scripts for Feinstein, Noonan, & Seligman (submitted to AAS Journals)

We note that several data products are too large to be hosted on GitHub. These include:
- stacked_3I_1-2.npy
- stacked_A918PE_2-3.npy

These additional data products will be found on Zenodo upon publication of the manuscript.
