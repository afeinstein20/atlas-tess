Data and Python scripts for Feinstein, Noonan, & Seligman (submitted to AAS Journals)

We note that several data products are too large to be hosted on GitHub. These include:
- stacked_3I_2-3_v4.npy
- stacked_3I_1-2_v4.npy
- stacked_A918PE_2-3.npy

These additional data products will be found on Zenodo shortly. We note that these additional files include the following data:

- calibrated FFI shift-stacked cutouts, centered on 3I/ATLAS
- background removed shift-stacked cutouts, centered on 3I/ATLAS
- affiliated errors
- quality flag for crowded versus non-crowded fields
- the time of each integration, in MJD
