# Precovery of 3I/ATLAS in the TESS Full-Frame Images

Data and Python scripts for Feinstein, Noonan, & Seligman (in preparation)

We note that several data products are too large to be hosted on GitHub. These include:
- stacked_3I_1-2.npy

These additional data products will be found on Zenodo upon publication of the manuscript.
